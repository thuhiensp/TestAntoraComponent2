= Usage

We explain quickly how to use PonySDK v3. The syntax is very similar to HTML. 

Using PonySDK v3 to creat some widgets, for example a <div> and a <button>:

image::usage_creat_object.PNG[]

and to modify its attributes, for example "id" and "innerHTML":

image::usage_modify_field.PNG[]

To show in browser, we need add them to the <body>:

image::usage_add_widget.PNG[]

The result in browser is:

image::usage_browser.PNG[]

To subscribe an event, for exemple a click on <button>, and request some informations about this event,
 for exemple, ClientX, Client Y:
 
image::usage_event.PNG[]

If an user's web click on the button, we have:

image::usage_result.PNG[]

PonySDK v3 gives you the possibility to create and manipulate with the graphicals objects that do not exist in GWT. For exemple:

image::usage_video.PNG[]

will show a <video> with the given source:

image::usage_video_browser.PNG[]
