= Server Side +

In this version, we replace and add some Java classes to the server side that allow us to create and manipulate all objects of web. +
This code is automatically generated from Webidl files. These classes are separated by 3 main groups: eventTarget, event, callback. +

== EventTarget + 
These classes represent the objects that can receive events and may have listeners for them. All widget graphique in userâ€™s web page is managed by a similar object of this groupe on the server-side. 
We have in these classes the possibility to change the values of their properties (those which are allowed to modify by
browser) and execute some callbacks when a user activates its objects on the browser. This type of callback is done by using an on-event handler attribute(like onclick, on keypress, onfocus,etc) 
with a function as its values. +

== Event + 

This group represents an event which takes place in the DOM. There are many types of events, each of them corressponds to a class of ce group.
Events are described by a hierarchy whose the parent classe is Event. For example:

image::event.PNG[]

Suppose we want to retrieve some informations of an event hired on a graphical widget by an user on browser. If we transfer all fields of this event to the server, 
it will cost a lot of bandwidth and memory, therefore, it makes our application less efficient. 

The solution we have adopted is to offer our users the possibility to choose informations he wants to capture at the moment he subscribe to an event on a graphic widget.

== Callback +

All members of this group are Java interfaces that will be implemented by the users at the moment of subscription for an event. All on-event handlers attributes of EventTarget group have the type callback.
This allows us manage events on the graphical objects as its special atributes. 
Once user's web trigger the event, the browser will send a message to the Pony Server to tell him execute the tasks entrusted to him.
