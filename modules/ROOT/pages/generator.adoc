Webidl is an interface definition language that can be used to describe interfaces that are intended to be implemented in web browsers.
Web IDL is an IDL variant with a number of features that allow the behavior of common script objects in the web platform to be specified more readily.

== Generator + 

We developed a tool that automatically generates Java classes and JavaScript scripts for PonySDK based on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/WebIDL_bindings[WebIdl].
Thanks to this automatic generation, we are able to create all web objects, including HTML and SVG widgets. +
