== PonySDK Version 2+
PonySDK v2 is an open source project and application that uses open source tools built on the Java platform to help you develop Web applications quickly and efficiently 
https://github.com/Nciaravola/PonySDK[PonySDK].

PonySDK v3 encapsulates a Web server (for now, Jetty) on the backend side, and use srcipt JavaScript on the frontend side. +
The main difference in this version is that we are no longeur dependent to gwt. +
Moreover, an important part of server-side and client-side is automatically generated by using the source Webidl.
This not only allows PonySDK to create all the objects of the modern web, but to be evolved when Webidl will be advanced.
