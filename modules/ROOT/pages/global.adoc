When a browser is connected to a Pony Server it will initially use HTTP protocol to retrieve HTML, JavaScript and other web resources. 
Then, when executing a script provided by the server, the browser will make a request to switch to WebSocket protocol.
Once the WebSocket connection is established, it will be used for the main communication between the two ends for the remainder of the life of the session. 
Messages sent from the server to the client are encoded as binary and composed of key-value frames. 
They are often used to enrich and update the web page(s) with graphical widgets.

On the other hand, messages sent from the client to the server are encoded as JSON objects. They often reflect user’s actions.

Every widget in the user’s web page is managed by a similar object on the server-side that is generated automaticaly by using the source webidl.
